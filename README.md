### What is this?  
A IA that can generate MIDI files from other MIDI samples. This is a very early version of it. The MIDI data is of Artist like OMFG, Alan Walker, Electro Light, and other more music style. But you can change it.

The data_preprocessing.py extracts notes, notes durations, and bpm of the .mid file. And create .pkl files with that information, so the neural network can be trained.

Sorry my english.
